Making chicken adobo is easy! 
Mix the all the ingredients in a large pot. 
Boil the chicken over high heat for about 5 minutes. Lower the heat, cover and let the chicken simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. 
Remove the lid and simmer until the sauce is reduced and thickened and the chicken is tender, about 20 more minutes. (If the sauce does not thicken well, just add a spoon of flour). 
Serve the chicken with steamed rice. 
I promise it will be delicious!
